# Anomaly Detection System for Complex Datasets

## Overview
This project develops an anomaly detection system to identify unusual patterns in complex datasets, such as financial transactions or sensor data, to detect fraud, errors, or critical events like equipment malfunctions. The system is designed to be accurate, scalable, and adaptable across diverse data types. Using Python in Google Colab, I implemented three machine learning algorithms—K-means Clustering, DBSCAN, and an enhanced Isolation Forest with custom density-based scoring—achieving **96.67% accuracy** and a **7% precision improvement** over the standard Isolation Forest. The project addresses challenges like high-dimensional data and rare anomalies, making it suitable for real-world applications such as fraud detection or medical diagnostics.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust anomaly detection system to identify unusual patterns in datasets, such as fraudulent transactions or faulty sensor readings.
- Ensure the system is adaptable to various data types with high accuracy and precision.
- Overcome challenges like high-dimensional data and rare anomalies through innovative algorithm enhancements and optimization.

## Dataset
The system was tested on complex datasets, including:
- **Financial Transactions**: To detect fraudulent activities.
- **Sensor Data**: To identify irregular readings or equipment malfunctions.

Due to proprietary restrictions, sample datasets are not included in this repository. The system is designed to work with any tabular dataset in CSV format containing numerical or categorical features. Preprocessing scripts handle data cleaning, normalization, and dimensionality reduction for compatibility with diverse data types.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language for development.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment for coding and leveraging computational resources (e.g., GPUs).
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization for exploratory analysis and result interpretation (optional).

## Methodology
The system combines multiple algorithms to ensure robustness and adaptability across datasets. The key steps are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Used Pandas to clean data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing features (e.g., z-score standardization).
   - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality while preserving 95% of data variance, addressing computational challenges in high-dimensional datasets.

2. **Algorithms Implemented**:
   - **K-means Clustering**:
     - Grouped similar data points to identify anomalies as points far from cluster centroids.
     - **Limitation**: Effective only for spherical data distributions, making it less suitable for complex datasets.
     - Tuned the number of clusters (K) using the elbow method.
   - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
     - Detected outliers in dense regions, effective for datasets with varied shapes and densities.
     - **Limitation**: O(N²) time complexity, making it inefficient for large datasets.
     - Tuned parameters like epsilon (distance threshold) and minimum points.
   - **Isolation Forest with Density-Based Scoring**:
     - Used the standard Isolation Forest for efficient anomaly detection by isolating points through random splits.
     - **Limitation**: Struggled with local anomalies (outliers close to normal data), critical for applications like heart disease prediction where high accuracy is essential.
     - **Innovation**: Enhanced the Isolation Forest with custom **density-based scoring** at leaf nodes, inspired by DBSCAN, to improve detection of local anomalies while maintaining efficiency.

3. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**:
   - Trained models using Scikit-learn, optimizing hyperparameters via grid search (e.g., K for K-means, epsilon for DBSCAN, contamination for Isolation Forest).
   - Adjusted models to increase sensitivity to rare anomalies, addressing the challenge of imbalanced data.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy and precision metrics.
   - Achieved **96.67% accuracy** and a **7% precision improvement** over the standard Isolation Forest due to the density-based scoring enhancement.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **High-Dimensional Data**:
   - **Challenge**: High-dimensional datasets slowed processing and introduced noise, impacting model performance.
   - **Solution**: Applied PCA to reduce dimensions while retaining 95% of data variance, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing critical information.

2. **Rare Anomalies**:
   - **Challenge**: Anomalies were underrepresented, particularly local anomalies close to normal data, which are critical in high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics.
   - **Solution**: Tuned model hyperparameters to increase sensitivity to outliers and introduced density-based scoring to enhance Isolation Forest’s ability to detect local anomalies.

3. **Algorithm Limitations**:
   - **Challenge**: K-means was limited to spherical clusters, DBSCAN was computationally expensive, and standard Isolation Forest missed local anomalies.
   - **Solution**: Combined the strengths of all three algorithms and developed a custom density-based scoring mechanism for Isolation Forest, creating a balanced, efficient, and accurate system.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 96.67%, demonstrating robust performance across diverse datasets.
- **Precision**: 7% improvement over the standard Isolation Forest, reducing false positives and improving reliability.
- **Adaptability**: The system effectively handles varied data types, from financial transactions to sensor readings.
- **Innovation**: The custom density-based scoring for Isolation Forest enhanced detection of local anomalies, making the system suitable for critical applications like fraud detection or medical diagnostics.
